# helloGo

This is just me re-learning some of the fun parts of go. I followed a [fireship blog](https://fireship.io/lessons/learn-go-in-100-lines/) and put all the sections of it in to folders.

```sh
# You can run each part of the blog by going into each folder and running the following pattern
cd <topic>
go build <topic>.go
./<topic>


# You can also just run these using go run
cd <topic>
go run <topic>.go
```
